# epf_with_stgnn
Code implementing electricity price forecasting with a spatial-temporal graph neural network.

# Roadmap
1. Implement simplified STGNN model on the data from three locations in the ERCOT market.
2. Traint/test on the data.
3. Present simplified model/performance to Moyi.
4. Iterate model to level of complexity as presented in the MTGNN paper.
5. Train/test this on data and compare to simpler model.
6. Present these results to Moyi.
7. Implement the R-vine copula method of constructing adjacency matrix.
